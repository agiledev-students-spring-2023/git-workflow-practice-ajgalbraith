## Review
I recently watched the movie about Edward Snowden. I had known already the story, as well as the general facts about surveillance and privacy, but the movie made me think more critically about privacy rights in the context of the internet.

I think it is hardly controversial to say that the internet is the future. The problem of privacy in the internet is not going away. For this reason, this article caught my eye.

The article describes a technique for privately accessing items from a private server. In order to ensure privacy, all elements in the database on the private server need to be accessed. The article describes a technique that makes this kind of retrieval much more efficient, though still expensive and slow compared to non-private methods. I found this technique interesting because it does not compromise the database, or make use of a distributed system (like Tor), which would be complex for companies to adopt. It would allow companies to maintain control over their database privately while allowing private querying. I am looking forward to learning about other methods, and most of all I am excited to see any such methods implemented by companies.
